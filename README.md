##Chess

###Information
* Ruby implementation of the classic game Chess
* Utilizes three-tiered classical inheritance within the Piece class in order to maintain code DRYness.
* Implements custom board duplication in order to make temporary moves for checking check and checkmate conditions.
* Leverages colorize and clean display rendering in order to enhance enjoyablility.
* NEW: Adds support for playing the [LI Chess](http://en.lichess.org) puzzle of the day, pulling down and decoding game state from API.

###Important

* To play, please download or clone this repo, and run 'ruby Game.rb' from within the directory.
* This game requires colorize to run, so 'gem install colorize' if you do not already have it.
* Because of the size of the Unicode characters, the rendering of the game is quite small. I recommend zooming in for the best experience.

####Enjoy Playing!
